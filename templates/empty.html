<p class="instruc">Enter an author whose work is on Project Gutenberg. For best results, use their full name, exact spelling, and choose
    someone from the turn of the century or before. I will use a Markov model to generate a nonsense paragraph with
    your author's rhythm and word choice. To give the best impression, I'll get as much material from your author as possible,
    so it could take as long as 20 seconds to load.</p>
